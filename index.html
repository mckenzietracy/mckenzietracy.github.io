          <p>My name is McKenzie Tracy, a University of Miami School of Communications graduate with a Bachelors in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Sports Administration.</p>

          <p>As a communications major, I have studied everything from media production and interpersonal communications to corporate communications. My focus on broadcast journalism specifically has greatly improved my skills from on camera to pre and post-production. These skills tied together with my minor in sports administration has helped me determine the market and audience of sports fans, giving me an advantage in this field.</p>

          <p>Throughout my internships with the University of Miami athletic department, I have been given the opportunity to further these skills in real world situations. My most proud accomplishment as an intern is having a hand in creating the IGTV show the Miami Minute where we give Cane fanâ€™s recaps of events and interviews from their favorite athletes and coaches. For the show, I help brainstorm ideas, write scripts, find b-roll, film, edit and host. Bringing an idea to fruition is one of the most educational experiences I could have ever been a part of.</p>

          <p>My goal is to take my hands-on experience to the next level and contribute to an even broader fan base. I hope to contribute my enthusiasm, ideas and skills to and grow in a position with any sports team who will allow me the opportunity.</p>
