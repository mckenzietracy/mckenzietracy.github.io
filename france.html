    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>France is one  of the most modern countries in today's world and is one of
    the leaders among Europe. France plays a very influential global role as members
    of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and
    others.</p>

    <p>Since 1958, it has developed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing
    system which is resistant to the vulnerabilities experienced in earlier times.</p>

    <p>In recent decades, its resolution and cooperation with Germany have
    proved vital to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction
    of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century,
    five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte,
    and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>

    <p>France is located in Western Europe, bordering the Bay of Biscay and English
    Channel, between Belgium and Spain, southeast of the UK; bordering the Mediterranean
    Sea, between Italy and Spain.</p>

    <h3>Climate</h3>

    <p>Generally cool winters and mild summers, but mild winters and hot summers along
    the Mediterranean; occasional strong, cold, dry, north-to-northwesterly wind
    known as the mistral.</p>
