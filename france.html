    <h1>France</h1>


    <p>France is one  of the most modern countries in today's world and is one of
    the leaders among Europe. France plays a very influential global role as members
    of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and
    others.</p>

    <p>Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing
    system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely
    parliamentary administrations.</p>

    <p>In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have
    proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction
    of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century,
    five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte,
    and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.</p>
