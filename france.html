        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>France is one  of the most modern countries in today's world and is one of the leaders among Europe. France plays a very influential global role as members of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and others.</p>

        <p>Since 1958, it has developed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system which is resistant to the vulnerabilities experienced in earlier times.</p>

        <p>In recent decades, its resolution and cooperation with Germany have proved vital to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.</p>
